# <a id="_ek0dv06ztlnt"></a>Cloudstitch Conversions

Cloudstitch automatically converts shared, user-friendly files into the kinds of files that programmers typically deal with.

*   MS Word and Google Docs are converted to **Markdown**
*   MS Excel and Google Sheets are converted to **JSON**
*   Sketch files are converted into **PNGs**

This means you can have your cake and eat it to:

*   The developers on your team can continue using Github
*   The non-techies on your team can continue using their Office Suite

Everyone wins!
